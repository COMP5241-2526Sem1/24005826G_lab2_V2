# ✅ FIXED: AI Text Processing Issue

## Problem Summary
The improve function was returning the system prompt along with the text instead of just the improved text:

**Before (Broken):**
```
Input: "AI is important for business"
Output: "Please improve the following text by enhancing clarity, grammar, structure, and overall readability while maintaining the original meaning. AI is important for business Artificial Intelligence has become a cornerstone of modern business strategy."
```

## Root Cause
The `improveText` function was constructing the user message by combining the instruction prompt with the actual text:
```typescript
// BROKEN CODE:
content: `${prompt}\n\n${text}`
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Simplified message construction** - Send only the text to the AI, not the instructions
2. **Enhanced text extraction** - Better pattern matching for various prompt formats
3. **Improved fallback logic** - Smarter deduplication and text processing

### Code Changes:

#### 1. Fixed improveText function:
```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
{
  role: 'user',
  content: text // Just send the text directly
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced text extraction patterns:
```typescript
const patterns = [
  /Please improve the following text[^.]*\.\s*(.*)/is,
  /enhancing clarity[^.]*\.\s*(.*)/is,
  /maintaining the original meaning[^.]*\.\s*(.*)/is,
  /\n\n(.*)/is, // Handle double newlines
  // ... other patterns
]
```

#### 3. Improved fallback processing:
```typescript
// Detects and removes duplicate sentences
// Provides specific improvements for AI/business content
// Ensures proper capitalization and punctuation
```
